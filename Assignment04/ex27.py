#The Truth Terms
#In Python we have the following terms (characters and phrases) for determining if something is ”True”
#or ”False.” Logic on a computer is all about seeing if some combination of these characters and some
#variables is True at that point in the program.
#• and
#• or
#• not
#• != (not equal)
#• == (equal)
#• >= (greater-than-equal)
#• <= (less-than-equal)
#• True
#• False
